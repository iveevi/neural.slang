# Benchmark Example

Performance comparison between PyTorch and SlangPy implementations.

## Overview

Benchmarks neural network operations (forward, backward, optimization) between PyTorch CUDA and SlangPy, measuring execution times across thousands of iterations.

## Usage

```bash
python -m examples.benchmark.main
```
